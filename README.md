# Arthur W. Silva Lima
Hello world!
I am an evolutionary ecologist, interested in quantitative ecology and
Bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in the establishment and maintenance of multi-species interactions, with emphasis on microalgae, bacteria and coral associated microbiomes. In my research, I combine experimental manipulation
and field work with individual-based modeling techniques to understand the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes.

I graduated with a BSc degree at Ecology, MSc at Computaional Modeling and DSc at Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology. As all things in a river, I've reached the sea and now I am a research tecnician at the Marine Phytoplankton laboratory, at UFRJ.
