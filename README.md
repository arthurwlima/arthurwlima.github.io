# Arthur W. Silva Lima

I am an evolutionary ecologist, interested in quantitative ecology and bioinformatics. I am broadly interested in microbial ecology, with emphasis on the establishment and maintenance of multi-species interactions. My main research subjects are microalgae, bacteria and coral associated microbiomes. In my research, I combine experimental manipulation
and field work with individual-based modeling techniques to understand the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes.

I have a BSc degree at Ecology, MSc at Computaional Modeling and DSc at Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology. I curently work as a research technician at the Marine Phytoplankton laboratory, at UFRJ. Despite the meanders, as everything from Rio, I've reached the sea... ;)
